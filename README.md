<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to install Docker. For a more detailed explanation about Docker and Containers see: https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Docker installation
```sh
sudo apt-get -y install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-compose docker docker-ce
```
* Use docker without `sudo` (optional)
```sh
sudo groupadd docker

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

su - ${USER}

id -nG
```
### Installation
 
1. Clone the docker_ros
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/dfvneto/docker_ros.git
```
2. Build Docker Image
```sh
./build.sh
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After installation, your docker image should have been built correctly. Now we have to access it:

1. Accessing Docker Container
```sh
./access_docker.sh
```
2. Now we can run our `roscore` node inside the container
```sh
roscore
```
*Note that our terminal is "locked", so we need to access our container through another terminal.*

3. Open another terminal on the root folder and run:
```sh
docker ps
```
Look for the container ID of our recently created image `ros_kinetic:$USER`.

4. Using the container ID run:
```sh
./new_view.sh DOCKER_ID
```
When inside the docker, you'll notice that the ros commands aren't available to us. We need to source the `setup.bash` file from ros sources.

5. To source our commands, simply run:
```sh
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
``` 
Now we are ready to try our container. On the first view of our container, roscore should be already running. On our second view we can try `rostopic list` to see if we can see `/rosout` and `/ros_agg` topics. The expected output should be:
```sh
/rosout
/rosout_agg
```
